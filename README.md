For this project, I was given the code that essentially created the game itself. What I did for this project was implement the reinforcement learning algorithm that the agent used to ‘solve’ the game. I used Keras and Tensorflow in order to get the agent to find the solution. 
Computer scientists use data and logic in order to solve problems and create or improves different systems. Computer scientists are important because information systems are becoming an integral part of our society and are helping to shape our future and improve our livelihood as a whole. I believe that I approach problems logically and I like to list out all the requirements I need in order to achieve my goal and create pseudocode or a flowchart that helps me visualize how I’ll make something that fulfills all the requirements that I listed. From there, I jump into the code and basically translate my pseudocode into real code. I feel that my ethical responsibilities when it comes to working in computer science is to stay true to my values and only participate in things that I believe won’t hurt anyone and help to improve our society.
